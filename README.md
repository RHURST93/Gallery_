# Gallery_

Upon buying the Motorola Razr 2023, I realized that it did not have a standalone gallery app such as the one that can be found on a samsung device. Introducing my gallery app for the Motorola Razr.

Specs:
This app is built with React Native, Typescript, and Expo to harness the power of the device's native features. Employing Expo-Image-Picker, and expo-media-library to allow users access to interact with the media files stored on the userâ€™s device, take photos and videos, and pick photos and video from the device.
